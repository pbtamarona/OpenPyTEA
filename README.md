# 🧩 OpenPyTEA
**OpenPyTEA** is an open-source Python toolkit for **techno-economic assessment (TEA)** of chemical and energy systems.  It integrates **equipment cost estimation**, **cash-flow analysis**, and **uncertainty evaluation** into a **transparent and reproducible** workflow.  **OpenPyTEA** bridges the gap between process modeling and economic evaluation—empowering both researchers and students to perform standardized TEA directly in Python.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Modular architecture:** distinct modules for cost correlations, equipment modeling, plant-level assessment, and uncertainty analysis.  
- **Transparent and reproducible:** all equations and assumptions are openly defined for full traceability.  
- **Built-in uncertainty tools:** automatic generation of tornado plots and Monte Carlo simulations.  
- **Extensible:** easy integration with life-cycle assessment or optimization frameworks.  
- **Educational use:** ideal for teaching process design and cost analysis without commercial software.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. **Equipment-level costing**

Each process unit (e.g., compressor, heat exchanger, reactor) is represented by an `Equipment` object:

```python
from openpytea.equipment import Equipment

compressor = Equipment(
    eq_type='compressor',
    sizing_var=5000,  # kW
    material='carbon_steel'
)

print(compressor.installed_cost)
```

Each equipment item retrieves its cost correlation from the internal database in `cost_correlations.py` and adjusts the cost to the desired year using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI).

### 2. **Plant-level techno-economic assessment**

Multiple equipment objects can be grouped into a `Plant` instance for full TEA

```python
from openpytea.plant import Plant

plant = Plant(
    name='Hydrogen_Liquefaction',
    equipment_list=[compressor],
    location='Netherlands',
    lifetime=20,
    interest_rate=0.08,
    tax_rate=0.21
)

plant.run_cashflow(product_price=3.5, production_rate=10000)
print(plant.results_summary())
```
Main outputs include:
- Capital expenditures (CAPEX): inside/outside battery limits, engineering, contingency, and location factors
- Operating expenditures (OPEX): utilities, maintenance, labor, taxes, and overheads
- Financial metrics: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Return on Investment (ROI), Payback Period (PBP), and Levelized Cost of Product (LCOP)

### 3. **Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis**

**OpenPyTEA** provides integrated tools for visual and probabilistic analysis of cost and performance drivers.

Tornado Plot (One-at-a-Time Sensitivity)
```python
from openpytea.analysis import tornado_plot

tornado_plot(
    plant,
    params=['CAPEX', 'fuel_price', 'interest_rate', 'product_price'],
    metric='LCOP'
)
```
Monte Carlo Simulation
```python
from openpytea.analysis import monte_carlo

results = monte_carlo(
    plant,
    n_iter=5000,
    variable_std={'CAPEX': 0.15, 'fuel_price': 0.10},
    metric='NPV'
)
```
Outputs include probability distributions and confidence intervals for LCOP or NPV—supporting uncertainty-informed decision-making.

## 📘 Example Workflows

Example notebooks are available in the `examples/` folder, including:

- Hydrogen liquefaction  
- Hydrogen production  
- Geothermal power  
- Distillation  

Run any example via:
```bash
jupyter notebook examples/hydrogen_liquefaction.ipynb
```
Each notebook demonstrates:
- Input definition and equipment configuration
- Cash-flow and investment evaluation
- Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
- Visualization of key economic indicators

## 🧑‍🏫 Educational Use

**OpenPyTEA** is suitable for chemical and process engineering education.
Students can perform full TEA using their simulation outputs—estimating capital, operating, and profitability metrics—without commercial software.
All algorithms are visible and modifiable, eliminating the “black-box” nature of most TEA tools.
