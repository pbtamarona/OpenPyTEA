    "## **Case study 2: Techno-economic comparison of hydrogen production pathways**\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Hydrogen production is a cornerstone of a low-carbon energy system, with technologies such as <b>steam methane reforming (SMR)</b>, <b>methane pyrolysis (MP)</b>, and <b>renewable-powered electrolysis</b> offering different trade-offs in efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Their varied energy demands, carbon intensities, and capital requirements make rigorous techno-economic assessment essential for identifying scalable, cost-effective pathways.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this case study, we apply <b>OpenPyTEA</b> to consistently evaluate the technical and economic performance of SMR, MP, and water electrolysis. The analysis covers capital and operating costs, specific energy consumption, levelized hydrogen cost, sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo–based uncertainty analysis. This demonstrates how <b>OpenPyTEA</b> streamlines scenario setup, parameter management, and results analysis, enabling transparent and reproducible comparison across hydrogen production technologies.</p>\n",

    "### Steam Methane Reforming\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the most established and widely used hydrogen production technology, supplying over half of global hydrogen demand. In SMR, methane reacts with high-temperature steam over a nickel catalyst to form synthesis gas, which is then processed in a water–gas shift reactor to increase hydrogen yield. While SMR is efficient and relatively low-cost, it is also carbon-intensive due to CO₂ generated in both the reforming reaction and furnace combustion. Carbon capture can reduce emissions but adds capital and operating costs, underscoring the need for techno-economic assessment to evaluate its long-term competitiveness.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Methane pyrolysis produces hydrogen without direct CO₂ emissions by thermally splitting methane into hydrogen and solid carbon. Depending on the heat source—such as plasma, molten metal, or non-catalytic reactors—the process exhibits different efficiencies and scale-up challenges. When powered by renewable or waste heat, methane pyrolysis offers a low-carbon hydrogen pathway, though its economics depend heavily on reactor design, heat supply, and the management or valorization of the solid carbon by-product.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>This case study follows the non-catalytic methane pyrolysis process of Keipi et al. (2018), using a regenerative heat-exchanger reactor (RHER). Methane is cracked at 1300 K, producing hydrogen while depositing solid carbon. In addition to external heating, hot product gases heat a circulating bed of ceramic beads, which in turn preheat the incoming methane. Most carbon forms on the bead surfaces and is removed through the circulation loop. For simplicity, detailed modeling of the bed-material loop and downstream carbon-handling units is omitted.</p>\n",

Combustion of a CH₄–air stream (COMP-3) supplies the thermal energy, and the resulting flue gas exits the system. Carbon particulates are separated in a cyclone and routed to a dedicated carbon-bed material separation unit for solid carbon recovery. The gas products from the reactor is cooled (COOLER-1, COOLER-2), compressed (COMP-2), and purified in a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit to produce a hydrogen stream, while unreacted methane is recycled to the reactor.</p>\n",

    "### Water Electrolysis\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>Water electrolysis produces hydrogen by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. Alkaline, PEM, and solid oxide electrolyzers vary in efficiency, operational flexibility, and capital cost, but all can deliver zero on-site emissions when powered by renewable electricity. Although widely viewed as a cornerstone of green hydrogen production, the economics of electrolysis remain highly sensitive to electricity price, capacity factor, and stack replacement costs. As renewable power becomes cheaper and more abundant, rigorous techno-economic assessment is essential for understanding the future role of electrolysis in low-carbon energy systems.</p>"
